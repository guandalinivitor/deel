## Hey, Vitor here 👨🏼‍💻, who made this test.

## Some texts to get in touch about how I solved the questions. 🙏🏼

changes on server.js -> making sure the db is up and running 

using nvm to manage node version 

Sequelize -> Never worked with this framework before, but really good explanation on website and docs. 

Didn't get enough time to make unit test and front-end calling the api. 
But if I get hired I will do my best working on BE and try to help on FE as well as I have been working as fullstack

On the end of the test it started to get confused, guess we need to explain a bit better how to get the values imho.

there are some comments on the code that helps explain my thoughts.
